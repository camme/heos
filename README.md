HEOS
====

Thid module lets you control and communicate with your Denond Heos speakers.

Its super early beta test so you cant do much with it except get the current stateof your first speaker.

The current version can be tested with

    node develop/index.js

It will connect to your Heos system, get all speakers (players) and get the current playing media on the first player.
